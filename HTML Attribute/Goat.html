    The taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of spring lamb meat;[56] in fact, in the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, and in South Asia, the word 'mutton' denotes both goat and sheep meat.[57][58] However, some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison, depending on the age and condition of the goat. Its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of 4-methyloctanoic and 4-methylnonanoic acid.[59] The meat is made into dishes such as goat curry,[60] mutton satay,[61] and capra e fagioli.[62]

    Goats produce about 2% of the world's total annual milk supply.[63] Dairy goats produce an average of 540 to 1,180 kg (1,200 to 2,600 lb) of milk during an average 284-day lactation.[64] The milk can contain between around 3.5% and 5% butterfat according to breed.[65] Goat milk is processed into products including cheese[66] and Dulce de leche.[67]
